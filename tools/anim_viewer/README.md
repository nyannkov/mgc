# anim_viewer.py

A simple Flask-based web animation viewer for mgc animation data generated by `anim_gen.py`.

This tool serves animation metadata from a YAML file and the associated indexed-color BMP frame images over HTTP,  
and provides a web frontend for viewing the animations in a browser.

---

## Features

- Loads animation definitions from a YAML file (compatible with `anim_gen.py` output).
- Serves individual frame BMP files from a specified resource directory.
- Provides a web UI to preview animations.
- Configurable server host and port.

---

## Usage

```bash
python3 anim_viewer.py --yaml path/to/animation.yaml --port 5000 --host 127.0.0.1
```

- `--yaml` (required): Path to the animation YAML file defining animations and frames.

- `--port` (optional): Port number to run the HTTP server on. Default is 5000.

- `--host` (optional): IP address to bind the server to. Default is `127.0.0.1`.

## Web Interface
Once running, open your browser to:
```
http://<host>:<port>/
```

## Directory structure

The web interface loads the animation metadata and frame images and allows you to preview the animations.
```
anim_viewer.py
static/
  ├─ index.html
  └─ viewer.js
animation.yaml
frame_001.bmp
frame_002.bmp
```

- static/ folder contains the web UI files served by Flask.

- animation.yaml is your animation definition file.


## Notes
Frame BMP files must be indexed color (palette mode) as generated or used by anim_gen.py.

Ensure the YAML file references frame files relative to the resource directory.

The server runs with Flask's debug mode enabled for development purposes.
